        My name is Jonathan Smaw and I'm 15 years old as of October 10, 2015.</br> 
        I have 2 siblings, Kayla and Landon. Kayla is my younger sister.</br> 
        She is currently 13 and goes to the same school as me, Summit Shasta.</br> 
        Landon is my younger brother, is currently 12, and goes to Ben Franklin</br> 
        Intermediate school. I have been playing basketball for most of my life,</br> 
        so needless to say it's my favorite sport. I usually play as a power</br> 
        forward. I have a pet snake named mojo who is a corn boa. I love</br> 
        television, particularly sci-fi and crime fighting shows like "Arrow",</br> 
        "Flash", and "Vampire Diaries". I also love to read fiction action/adventure</br>
        novels, especially ones that are tied into mythology. Rick Roirdan is my</br>
        favorite author because he touches base on all of these genres. So, now</br>
        you know some things about me. Enjoy my webpage.
